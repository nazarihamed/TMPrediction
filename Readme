# TRAFFIC MATRIX PREDICTION

Assumption: each switch is connected to only one host

following in the code of monitoring module shows this assumption in a way that we extract ip address from dpid that we received stats from.

    if ip_src == "10.0.0.%d" %dpid_rec:
        traffic[int(ip_dst.split('.')[3]) - 1] += number_bytes
