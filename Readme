# TRAFFIC MATRIX PREDICTION

Assumption: each switch is connected to only one host

following in the code of monitoring module shows this assumption in a way that we extract ip address from dpid that we received stats from.

# Calculates number of BYTES (not bits)
    if ip_src == "10.0.0.%d" %dpid_rec:
        traffic[int(ip_dst.split('.')[3]) - 1] += number_bytes 


Following is the instruction to run the monitoring and forwarding module with STP enabled.

run ryu controller with following command:
    ryu-manager --observe-links monitoring.py Routing_STP.py

run mininet for the following BSO topology located on Testbed/mininet directory:
    sudo python3 bso-topo.py

# Data Output format for 3x3 hosts
    x = number of BYTES
